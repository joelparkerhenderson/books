# Program Management for Open Source Projects

## Key Concepts

This book establishes that program management is an essential but often overlooked discipline in open source development, guided by the principle that everyone does program management but some do it poorly. The author presents program management as the art of coordinating volunteer contributors with diverse interests toward shared project goals, bringing structure to community agreements rather than imposing top-down control. Core topics include balancing priorities across competing concerns, managing risks through identification and mitigation strategies, designing suitable processes that serve the community rather than constraining it, and shepherding releases through defined life cycles with clear milestones and criteria. The book emphasizes that successful open source projects thrive not by accident but through deliberate coordination that reduces communication overhead, establishes predictable processes, and provides reliable insight into project status for stakeholders.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book serves open source project leaders, release managers, technical steering committee members, and enthusiastic contributors who find themselves coordinating work across a project without formal training in program management. Developers transitioning from pure coding roles to leadership positions will appreciate the structured approach to the non-technical challenges of running community-driven projects, learning why volunteer coordination differs fundamentally from traditional project management with employed teams. The content particularly benefits those who recognize their projects need better organization but struggle to implement processes that respect open source culture, offering a framework for conscious decision-making about schedules, feature proposals, bug triage, and release criteria. Anyone frustrated by chaotic communication patterns, missed deadlines, or unclear project direction will find practical solutions grounded in real-world experience from projects like Fedora.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to design release life cycles that balance stability with innovation, create feature proposal templates and approval processes that respect community input, and establish bug tracking systems with effective triage workflows that prioritize work appropriately. The book provides guidance on running productive meetings that justify their time investment, building release schedules using either time-based or feature-based models with meaningful milestones, and developing status reporting mechanisms that keep stakeholders informed without overwhelming contributors. Program managers will discover techniques for managing single points of failure and preventing contributor burnout, methods for conducting retrospectives that improve processes over time, and strategies for choosing tools that meet project requirements across distributed teams. The appendix on tool selection helps teams evaluate options for bug trackers, communication platforms, and project management software, while chapters on decision-making and governance provide frameworks for resolving conflicts and giving voice to community members in ways that align with open source values.
