# Designed for Use

## Key Concepts

This book presents user interface design as a discipline grounded in understanding how people actually think and work rather than focusing solely on aesthetics or technical implementation. The core framework distinguishes between implementation models created by developers, represented models expressed through the interface, and mental models that users form about how things work, emphasizing that successful design bridges these gaps. Key concepts include designing for activities rather than personas, making hierarchical information scannable and discoverable, creating text that users can actually understand and use, and applying principles like Fitts's Law to make interfaces physically easier to use. The book stresses that usability comes from continuous research, testing with real users, and iterating based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.

## Who Should Read It and Why

Developers building applications or websites who lack formal design training will gain practical techniques for creating usable interfaces without becoming full-time designers. Product managers and team leads who need to understand what makes interfaces work will find the research-based approach valuable for making informed decisions and communicating with designers. The book is particularly useful for small teams where developers wear multiple hats and need to handle UI design themselves, as it provides concrete methods like card sorting, paper prototyping, and contextual interviews that anyone can apply. Anyone frustrated by users not understanding their carefully crafted interfaces will discover why their mental models don't match user expectations and how to fix the disconnect.

## Practical Applications

The book provides actionable techniques starting with user research methods like job shadowing and contextual interviews to understand actual workflows, then creating personas and activity-centered designs based on real observations rather than stereotypes. Teams can apply paper prototyping for rapid iteration before writing code, use card sorting to create navigable hierarchies that match user mental models, and conduct guerrilla usability testing to catch problems early. Specific guidelines cover writing scannable text that communicates clearly, creating visual hierarchies through spacing and typography, designing animations that explain state changes rather than just looking pretty, and implementing undo functionality to eliminate interruptive confirmation dialogs. The emphasis on starting documentation and marketing materials early helps teams clarify what the product actually does and who it serves, while principles about consistency, discoverability, and avoiding modes provide clear criteria for evaluating design decisions throughout development.
