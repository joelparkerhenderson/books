# Design and Build Great Web APIs

## Key Concepts

Design and Build Great Web APIs presents a comprehensive methodology for creating web APIs that are robust, reliable, and resilient through an API-First approach that prioritizes design before implementation. The book structures the API development lifecycle into distinct phases spanning design, build, and release, emphasizing that great APIs begin with understanding user needs through Norman's Action Lifecycle model rather than jumping directly to code. It introduces readers to key design artifacts including sequence diagrams, ALPS descriptions, API Blueprint sketches, and OpenAPI specifications, demonstrating how each serves a specific purpose in communicating API behavior to different stakeholders. The methodology emphasizes iterative refinement, starting with simple models and progressively adding detail through sketching and prototyping phases before committing to implementation. Throughout, the book advocates for creating APIs that can evolve safely over time through careful versioning strategies that avoid breaking existing clients.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is essential for software developers, technical product managers, and architects responsible for designing or building web APIs, regardless of experience level. Newcomers will gain a systematic framework for approaching API development that prevents common pitfalls, while experienced developers will discover structured methods for improving their design process and ensuring APIs meet both technical and business requirements. The hands-on approach with chapter exercises makes it valuable for teams adopting API-First practices or organizations establishing API governance standards. Anyone involved in microservices architecture, platform development, partner integrations, or building APIs for mobile and web applications will benefit from the book's focus on creating interfaces that remain stable while accommodating change. The practical emphasis on tooling including curl, Git, Postman, SwaggerHub, and Heroku makes it immediately applicable to real-world projects.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to model API workflows by identifying actions, data requirements, and processing steps before writing code, create machine-readable API descriptions using ALPS that serve as single sources of truth throughout development, sketch API interactions with API Blueprint and validate them with stakeholders early in the design process, prototype APIs using OpenAPI and generate interactive documentation and mock servers for testing, implement APIs using repeatable patterns that separate concerns and maintain consistency, write comprehensive tests using Postman and Newman that verify both functional behavior and non-functional requirements, secure APIs using OAuth 2.0 and implement proper authentication and authorization, deploy APIs to production using continuous integration pipelines with automated testing, and safely modify existing APIs by following the three rules of API evolution that preserve backward compatibility. The book demonstrates these skills through a complete worked example of building an employee onboarding API for a fictional company, providing templates, checklists, and code samples that readers can adapt to their own projects.
