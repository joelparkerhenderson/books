# iOS 10 SDK Development

## Key Concepts

This book teaches building native iOS applications using Swift programming language and iOS 10 SDK, covering UIKit framework for user interfaces, Foundation for core functionality, and iOS-specific patterns that make applications feel native. The core iOS development approach uses Model-View-Controller architecture separating data models from views coordinated by controllers, delegation pattern enabling loose coupling through protocol conformance, and target-action connecting UI events to handler methods. Key concepts include view controllers managing screen lifecycles and transitions, Auto Layout creating adaptive interfaces working across different device sizes, and storyboards visually designing interfaces connecting screens through segues. The book covers table views displaying scrolling lists efficiently reusing cells, collection views presenting grid layouts with flexible item arrangements, and networking using URLSession for REST API communication with asynchronous completion handlers. Modern iOS 10 features include user notifications with rich media and custom actions, SiriKit enabling voice command integration for supported domains, and messages app extensions creating iMessage applications.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets developers new to iOS with programming background wanting comprehensive introduction to platform, experienced iOS developers updating knowledge for iOS 10 SDK additions, and mobile developers from Android seeking to understand iOS development patterns and ecosystem. Those who tried learning iOS through scattered online tutorials will appreciate structured progression from fundamentals through complete applications deployed to devices or simulator. The content particularly benefits web developers transitioning to native mobile development learning differences between web and native paradigms like view lifecycles, native UI components, and Apple's Human Interface Guidelines defining platform conventions. Anyone building apps for iPhones or iPads needing to understand Apple's frameworks, tools, and review process will find essential guidance from Xcode basics through App Store submission.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to create projects in Xcode configuring app metadata and capabilities, design interfaces using Interface Builder dragging components or writing Auto Layout constraints programmatically, and connect interface elements to code through outlets and actions enabling interaction. The book demonstrates presenting data in table views implementing delegate and datasource protocols, building navigation hierarchies using navigation controllers pushing and popping view controllers, and passing data between view controllers through properties or segue preparation. Practical examples cover networking with URLSession fetching JSON from REST APIs, parsing responses using Codable for type-safe deserialization, and updating UI on main thread after background network calls. Advanced topics include implementing collection views with custom layouts, using Core Data for local persistence managing object graphs through managed contexts, and integrating maps using MapKit displaying annotations and handling user location. The book provides guidance on handling app lifecycle events responding to background, foreground, and termination events, managing memory through ARC understanding strong and weak references preventing retain cycles, and debugging using Xcode's debugger, instruments for profiling, and crash reports. iOS 10 features cover implementing user notifications requesting permission and handling local or remote notifications, creating SiriKit extensions enabling voice commands for supported intents, and building iMessage apps creating stickers or interactive experiences. Deployment topics include code signing with certificates and provisioning profiles, TestFlight for beta distribution gathering feedback before public release, and App Store submission preparing screenshots, descriptions, and metadata meeting Apple's guidelines for review approval.
