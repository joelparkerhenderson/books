# Machine Learning in Elixir

## Key Concepts

This book demonstrates building machine learning applications using Elixir's functional programming paradigm and concurrent runtime, showing how BEAM VM capabilities make it suitable for production ML systems requiring reliability and concurrency beyond Python's single-threaded execution. The core approach leverages Nx for numerical computing providing tensor operations similar to NumPy but with compilation to GPU and TPU, Axon for neural network definition and training offering high-level API comparable to Keras, and Explorer for data manipulation bringing dataframe concepts from Pandas to Elixir ecosystem. Key concepts include understanding that Elixir excels at ML deployment and serving rather than research and experimentation, using processes for parallel data processing and model serving, and integrating trained models from Python ecosystem when Elixir's ML libraries don't cover specific algorithms. The book emphasizes Elixir's strengths in building reliable production systems that stay available under load, handle failures gracefully through supervision trees, and scale horizontally across machines more easily than Python's GIL-constrained concurrency.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets Elixir developers wanting to add machine learning capabilities to applications without switching to Python for data science portions, ML practitioners curious whether functional programming offers advantages for building production ML systems, and teams frustrated by Python's deployment challenges seeking alternatives for reliable model serving. Developers who love Elixir but thought ML required Python will discover growing Elixir ecosystem bringing ML capabilities to functional programming paradigm. The content particularly benefits those building systems where ML is component rather than core focus, like recommendation engines in e-commerce platforms or anomaly detection in monitoring systems, where Elixir's concurrency and fault tolerance shine. Anyone maintaining Python-based ML services struggling with concurrency issues, memory leaks, or deployment complexity will appreciate Elixir's robustness and operational simplicity inherited from Erlang's telecom heritage.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to process tabular data using Explorer performing transformations, cleaning, and feature engineering similar to Pandas workflows, build neural networks using Axon defining layers and training loops for supervised learning problems, and leverage Nx for numerical operations executing efficiently whether on CPU, GPU, or TPU without code changes. The book demonstrates loading pre-trained models from Python frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for inference in Elixir applications, implement traditional ML algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or k-means clustering using libraries like Scholar, and build data pipelines using Flow for parallel processing of large datasets. Practical examples cover creating recommendation systems using collaborative filtering, implementing natural language processing for text classification or sentiment analysis, and building time series forecasting models for prediction problems. Advanced topics include serving ML models through Phoenix applications handling concurrent requests efficiently, implementing A/B testing frameworks comparing model performance in production, and using GenServers for stateful model management caching predictions and managing model updates. The book provides deployment strategies using releases for self-contained artifacts, monitoring approaches tracking model performance and data drift, and integration patterns combining Elixir ML capabilities with Python ecosystem through ports or NIFs when necessary. Production considerations cover batch versus real-time inference trade-offs, handling model versioning and rollback, and scaling inference across distributed Elixir clusters for high-throughput applications.
