# Agile Web Development with Rails 6

## Key Concepts

This book teaches building web applications using Ruby on Rails framework through iterative development of realistic e-commerce application, demonstrating how Rails conventions eliminate boilerplate enabling rapid development while maintaining code organization and test coverage. The core Rails philosophy of convention over configuration means developers follow established patterns for directory structure, naming, and file organization rather than endless configuration files, with sensible defaults handling common requirements while allowing customization when needed. Key concepts include MVC architecture separating presentation logic in views from business logic in models coordinated by controllers, Active Record providing object-relational mapping eliminating SQL boilerplate while maintaining database flexibility, and REST architectural style guiding resource-oriented URL design and HTTP verb usage. The book covers Rails 6 features including Action Cable for WebSocket communication enabling real-time features, Active Storage simplifying file uploads to cloud services, and Webpacker integrating modern JavaScript tooling replacing legacy asset pipeline.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets developers new to Rails wanting comprehensive guide from installation through deployment building complete application, Ruby programmers comfortable with language seeking framework expertise for web development, and web developers from other frameworks curious how Rails approaches common problems differently. Those overwhelmed by JavaScript framework complexity will appreciate Rails handling frontend concerns through server-rendered views with progressive enhancement, while backend developers can focus on business logic letting Rails manage HTTP details. The content particularly benefits teams wanting rapid prototyping velocity for MVPs or internal tools where Rails conventions enable small teams to ship complete applications quickly, along with developers maintaining legacy Rails applications needing current best practices for Rails 6 upgrade path. Anyone building data-driven applications with standard CRUD operations will find Rails scaffold generators and conventions accelerating routine development while keeping architecture maintainable as applications grow.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to generate Rails applications with sensible defaults, create database migrations defining schema changes tracked in version control, and use Active Record models including associations like has_many and belongs_to expressing relationships declaratively. The book demonstrates implementing controllers handling HTTP requests through actions mapping to views, creating views using ERB templates mixing HTML with embedded Ruby, and applying layouts sharing common page structure across application. Practical examples cover form handling with form_for helpers generating appropriate HTML and handling validation errors, implementing authentication through bcrypt and has_secure_password for secure user sessions, and adding authorization logic controlling feature access based on user roles. Advanced topics include Action Cable implementation for features like live chat or real-time notifications, Active Storage integration uploading files to S3 or other cloud storage, and Turbolinks speeding navigation by replacing page body without full reload. The book provides testing strategies using Rails built-in testing framework, deployment guidance using Capistrano or platform-as-service providers, and performance optimization through fragment caching and database query optimization. Production topics cover environment management separating development, test, and production configurations, asset pipeline compilation bundling and minifying CSS/JavaScript, and monitoring applications using tools like New Relic or built-in Rails instrumentation tracking slow queries and rendering bottlenecks.
