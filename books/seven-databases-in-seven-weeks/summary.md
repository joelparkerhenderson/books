# Seven Databases in Seven Weeks

## Key Concepts

This book surveys seven database systems representing different data models and use cases, demonstrating that relational databases don't solve all data storage problems optimally and modern applications benefit from polyglot persistence choosing appropriate storage for each data type. The covered databases include PostgreSQL representing powerful traditional RDBMS with advanced features, Riak providing distributed key-value storage with eventual consistency, HBase offering column-family NoSQL scaling to massive datasets, MongoDB delivering document storage with flexible schemas, CouchDB emphasizing offline-first applications with built-in replication, Neo4j modeling graph relationships efficiently for connected data, and Redis offering in-memory data structures as database. Each database is explored through three days progressing from installation and basic operations through intermediate queries to advanced features showcasing strengths, with exercises building hands-on experience comparing approaches to same problems across different models.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets developers comfortable with SQL wanting exposure to NoSQL alternatives understanding when to use each, architects designing systems needing informed opinions about data store choices beyond defaulting to familiar MySQL or PostgreSQL, and database administrators curious about trends beyond traditional relational model. Those who assumed all data belongs in relational tables will discover document databases like MongoDB simplify certain schemas, graph databases like Neo4j excel at connected data traversal, and key-value stores like Redis provide blazing performance for caching. The content particularly benefits teams choosing databases for new projects wanting to evaluate options matching requirements around consistency, availability, partition tolerance, and query patterns rather than picking based on familiarity or hype. Anyone maintaining systems experiencing growing pains from outgrowing single relational database will appreciate learning about specialized databases handling specific workloads like Riak's distributed architecture or HBase's massive scale capabilities.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn PostgreSQL's advanced features beyond basic SQL including full-text search, JSON data types, and window functions providing analytical capabilities, Riak's eventual consistency and vector clocks handling distributed conflicts, and HBase's column-family model storing sparse data efficiently across distributed clusters. The book demonstrates MongoDB's flexible document schemas enabling rapid schema evolution, CouchDB's map-reduce views and built-in HTTP API simplifying application integration, Neo4j's Cypher query language expressing graph traversals naturally impossible in SQL, and Redis's rich data structures including lists, sets, and sorted sets enabling complex operations atomically. Practical examples cover modeling social networks in Neo4j leveraging graph databases' strength at relationship queries, building distributed counters in Riak handling high write throughput with eventual consistency, and implementing real-time analytics in Redis using pub/sub and sorted sets. Advanced topics include PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY for database-driven messaging, MongoDB's aggregation framework for complex data processing, and CouchDB's conflict resolution strategies for distributed applications. The book provides decision frameworks comparing databases across dimensions like consistency models, query capabilities, scaling characteristics, and operational complexity, helping teams choose appropriate tools matching specific requirements. Performance considerations cover understanding consistency trade-offs in CAP theorem, recognizing when denormalization in NoSQL outweighs normalization in RDBMS, and applying appropriate indexes or sharding strategies for each database type.
