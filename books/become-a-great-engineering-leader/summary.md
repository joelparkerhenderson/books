# Become a Great Engineering Leader

## Key Concepts

This book guides technical leaders transitioning from individual contributor success to leading engineering teams and organizations, addressing the shift from delivering code personally to multiplying effectiveness through others. Core leadership principles include servant leadership putting team success above personal achievement, building trust through consistency and integrity rather than authority, and creating psychological safety where team members feel comfortable taking risks and admitting mistakes. The content covers balancing technical involvement maintaining credibility and understanding current challenges with strategic thinking about longer-term architecture and organizational needs. Key concepts include developing others through coaching and mentorship rather than solving all problems yourself, communicating effectively across technical and business stakeholders translating between different languages and priorities, and building resilient teams that function well even during your absence. The book emphasizes that great engineering leadership requires both technical credibility and people skills, recognizing that many engineers excel at the former while neglecting the latter.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book serves senior engineers considering management tracks who want to understand what leadership actually entails beyond attending meetings and reviewing code, recently promoted engineering managers struggling with the identity shift from maker to multiplier, and established leaders seeking to develop their leadership skills more intentionally. Individual contributors who have been informally leading through influence and mentorship will discover how to formalize these skills and expand their impact, while those thrust into leadership without preparation will find frameworks for navigating common challenges. The content particularly benefits technical leaders in fast-growing companies where scaling teams and maintaining quality under growth pressure create leadership challenges beyond initial startup phases. Anyone experiencing the frustration of being pulled into technical firefighting when they should focus on strategic leadership, or struggling to let go of hands-on coding despite management responsibilities, will appreciate guidance on finding balance between technical involvement and people leadership.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to conduct effective one-on-ones focusing on career development and removing obstacles, give feedback that changes behavior through specific examples and forward-looking improvement plans, and delegate work appropriately matching tasks to team members' growth goals while maintaining accountability. The book demonstrates building team culture through establishing clear values and behavioral norms, running productive meetings with clear outcomes rather than status theater, and making decisions balancing speed with team input and buy-in. Practical guidance covers hiring well by designing interview processes assessing both technical skills and cultural contribution, onboarding new team members for rapid productivity and cultural integration, and managing performance including difficult conversations about expectations and improvement plans. Advanced leadership topics include managing up effectively giving your manager visibility into team accomplishments and needs, navigating organizational politics advancing team interests without manipulation, and scaling yourself through delegation, documentation, and developing other leaders enabling organizational growth beyond personal capacity. The book provides frameworks for setting technical vision and strategy, balancing innovation with maintenance and technical debt reduction, and advocating for engineering priorities including adequate time for quality, testing, and infrastructure work often invisible to non-technical stakeholders.
