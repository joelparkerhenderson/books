# Dart for Hipsters

## Key Concepts

This book explores Dart as modern object-oriented language designed for web and mobile development, emphasizing its optional typing system, clean syntax, and performance characteristics making it suitable for large-scale applications. The core Dart philosophy combines familiarity for developers from Java or JavaScript backgrounds with modern features like sound null safety preventing null reference errors at compile time, futures and streams for asynchronous programming, and isolates for concurrent execution without shared memory. Key concepts include everything being an object including functions and null, cascade notation for chaining method calls on same object reducing repetition, and mixins for code reuse across class hierarchies without multiple inheritance complexity. The book covers Dart's type system supporting both dynamic and static typing with type inference reducing annotation burden, async/await syntax for readable asynchronous code, and Dart's VM enabling hot reload during development with ahead-of-time compilation for production.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets web developers curious about Dart beyond Flutter wanting to understand language fundamentals independent of framework, mobile developers considering Flutter needing solid Dart foundation before diving into widgets, and programmers from statically typed backgrounds evaluating whether Dart's optional typing suits their preferences. Those who tried Dart briefly and dismissed it based on initial impression will discover modern Dart with null safety and improved tooling differs substantially from earlier versions. The content particularly benefits developers building complex web applications where Dart's compilation to JavaScript provides optimization while maintaining readable source code, along with teams valuing strong typing for large codebases where refactoring safety and IDE support matter. Anyone building cross-platform applications and comparing technologies like React Native or Xamarin will appreciate understanding Dart's approach to code sharing and platform integration.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to write functions using arrow syntax for concise single-expression functions, optional parameters with default values, and first-class function capabilities passing functions as arguments, handle asynchronous operations using futures with then chaining or async/await for sequential-looking code, and manage streams for sequences of events like user input or network data. The book demonstrates creating classes with constructors including named constructors for factory patterns, implementing interfaces and abstract classes defining contracts, and using mixins for behavior sharing across unrelated classes. Practical examples cover collection manipulation using lists, sets, and maps with literal syntax and functional methods like map, where, and fold, string interpolation for readable string building, and exception handling with try-catch-finally blocks. Advanced topics include null safety migration understanding nullable and non-nullable types preventing null errors at compile time, isolates for concurrent programming communicating through message passing like Erlang processes, and libraries for code organization using import, export, and part directives. The book provides web development patterns using dart:html for DOM manipulation, futures for XMLHttpRequest wrapping, and code organization separating logic from presentation. Mobile development context explains Dart's role in Flutter though focusing on language rather than framework specifics, compilation modes including JIT during development for hot reload and AOT for production optimizing startup time and performance. Tooling coverage includes using pub for package management installing dependencies from pub.dev, writing tests using built-in test package with setup, teardown, and expectations, and using analyzers enforcing code quality through linting rules and static analysis.
