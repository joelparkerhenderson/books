# Programming WebAssembly with Rust

## Key Concepts

WebAssembly is a low-level bytecode format that runs in modern browsers and other hosts with near-native performance, enabling languages like Rust to compile to a portable binary format that executes safely in a sandboxed environment. The core architecture uses a stack machine with linear memory that modules can read and write, along with tables for storing function references, all accessed through a carefully designed import/export system. Unlike JavaScript, WebAssembly provides deterministic performance, strong typing, and the ability to bring existing codebases in languages like C, C++, and Rust to the web without rewriting. The book demonstrates that WebAssembly's potential extends far beyond browsers to embedded devices, serverless functions, and anywhere a safe, fast, portable execution environment is needed. Rust emerges as an ideal language for WebAssembly due to its zero-cost abstractions, memory safety without garbage collection, and the enthusiastic tooling support from the Rust community.

## Who Should Read It and Why

Web developers looking to build faster, more powerful applications will discover how WebAssembly enables use cases previously impossible in browsers like games, video editing, and scientific computing. Rust programmers wanting to target the web will find comprehensive guidance on compiling Rust to WebAssembly and integrating with JavaScript through tools like wasm-bindgen and frameworks like Yew. Embedded developers and systems programmers will appreciate how WebAssembly provides a safe, sandboxed execution environment for running untrusted code on IoT devices and other resource-constrained platforms. Anyone interested in the future of web development will gain insight into how WebAssembly fundamentally changes what's possible in browsers while maintaining backward compatibility. Developers who think there's more to WebAssembly than just web applications will be excited by chapters on hosting modules outside browsers and building for ARM devices.

## Practical Applications

Readers build progressively complex applications starting with a WebAssembly checkers game that demonstrates core concepts like memory management and the import/export system, then move to integrating Rust-compiled WebAssembly with JavaScript for a rogue-like game with sophisticated DOM manipulation. The Yew framework chapter shows how to build a real-time chat application using React-like components entirely in Rust that compiles to WebAssembly. Advanced projects include creating a Rust-based WebAssembly interpreter that can host and run other WebAssembly modules, building an IoT system that runs WebAssembly indicator modules on Raspberry Pi to control LED hardware through GPIO, and implementing WARoS, a robot battle simulation system where WebAssembly modules control virtual robots. The book covers essential tooling including wasm-pack for packaging, wasm-bindgen for JavaScript interop, and the WebAssembly Text format for understanding module internals. Appendices explore security concerns like module signing and encryption, plus integrating WebAssembly with serverless platforms like OpenFaaS for running functions in the cloud.
