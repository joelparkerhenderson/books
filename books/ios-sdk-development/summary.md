# iOS SDK Development

## Key Concepts

This book teaches iOS development by building complete applications while explaining the fundamental concepts of the iOS SDK including Objective-C, the Model-View-Controller architecture, and the iOS programming stack. The core philosophy emphasizes understanding how frameworks like UIKit and Foundation work together, mastering memory management with Automatic Reference Counting, and building responsive concurrent applications using Grand Central Dispatch and blocks. The book covers essential iOS patterns including view controllers and their lifecycle, table views for displaying lists, storyboards for navigation, and iCloud integration for document persistence. Throughout, the focus is on learning not just syntax but the underlying design decisions that make iOS development distinctive.

## Who Should Read It and Why

Programmers looking to transition into iOS development from other platforms will find this book invaluable as it assumes general programming knowledge while explaining iOS-specific concepts thoroughly. The book is ideal for developers who want to understand the complete picture of iOS development rather than just copying code snippets, as it builds a recipe management application from the ground up while explaining every decision. Experienced developers familiar with other object-oriented languages will appreciate the detailed explanation of Objective-C's unique messaging system and memory management, while those new to mobile development will gain insight into constraints like screen sizes and device capabilities. Anyone who prefers learning by building real applications rather than studying isolated examples will benefit from the progressive, project-based approach.

## Practical Applications

Readers build a complete recipe management application that demonstrates all major iOS development concepts including creating and editing data, implementing user authentication, managing documents with iCloud storage, custom drawing with Core Graphics, and testing with unit tests and UI automation. The book covers practical necessities like handling the iPhone 5's different screen size using Auto Layout, implementing navigation between views using storyboards and container controllers, managing related data with Ecto relationships, and deploying apps through the App Store submission process. Advanced topics include asynchronous programming with Grand Central Dispatch to keep interfaces responsive, debugging techniques using Xcode's integrated debugger, performance testing with Instruments, and proper source control practices. The appendix on C fundamentals ensures developers understand the language underneath Objective-C, while chapters on testing show how to build reliability into apps from the start.
