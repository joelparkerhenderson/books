# iOS Apps with REST APIs - Summary

## Key Concepts

This book provides a practical guide for developers who need to integrate REST APIs with iOS applications using Swift. It focuses on the essential tasks of consuming JSON-based web services without getting lost in theoretical details or advanced iOS frameworks. The core topics include making HTTP requests using URLSession and Alamofire, parsing JSON responses into Swift model objects, implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication, displaying data in table views, and performing CRUD operations. The book uses GitHub's Gist API as a real-world example to demonstrate building a functional app that lists, creates, views, stars, and deletes gists, while teaching patterns that can be adapted to any REST API.

## Who Should Read It and Why

Software developers with experience in other programming languages who are getting started with iOS development will benefit most from this book, particularly those who need to quickly integrate existing web services into native iOS apps. Backend developers tasked with getting API data into iOS applications, Android or other mobile platform developers expanding to iOS, and frontend developers implementing native UIs without CSS will find the pragmatic, no-nonsense approach valuable. The book assumes basic object-oriented programming knowledge but not extensive iOS experience, making it ideal for developers who need to deliver working API-integrated apps quickly rather than those looking for comprehensive iOS fundamentals or game development guidance.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to build complete iOS applications that authenticate users, fetch data from REST APIs, and display it in native table views with features like pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling. The book covers implementing OAuth 2.0 flows, handling image loading from URLs, managing network errors and offline scenarios, and storing authentication tokens securely. Developers will gain the ability to create forms for adding new data, implement swipe-to-delete functionality, transition between list and detail views, and handle pagination when loading large datasets. The tutorial-style approach allows readers to either follow along building the example Gist app or adapt the patterns directly to their own API, making it immediately applicable to real-world projects that need to integrate with any JSON-based REST service.
