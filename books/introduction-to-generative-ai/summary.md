### Key concepts

Introduction to Generative AI provides foundational understanding of models that create new content rather than just classify or predict, covering GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and transformer-based generative models across text, images, audio, and code domains. The book explains core principles including latent space representations where models learn compressed features enabling generation, the training process for different generative architectures, and controlling generation through conditioning, prompts, or latent space manipulation. Core concepts include understanding generation quality metrics, the distinction between unconditional and conditional generation, and recognizing capabilities and limitations of different generative approaches for various content types and use cases.

### Who should read it and why

This book targets developers, data scientists, and technical professionals wanting to understand generative AI fundamentals before diving into specific implementations, requiring basic ML knowledge but building up generative concepts progressively. The material appeals to those evaluating generative AI for content creation, data augmentation, creative applications, or synthetic data generation, seeking conceptual clarity on how these models work. Readers benefit from understanding the landscape of generative techniques, when to use each approach, and what's possible versus hyped in generative AI applications.

### Practical applications

The book provides frameworks for selecting appropriate generative models for specific tasks, understanding training data requirements and quality considerations, and evaluating generated content quality. Readers learn practical considerations for deploying generative models including computational requirements, controlling generation outputs, detecting generated versus real content, and addressing ethical concerns around deepfakes, copyright, and misuse. The material covers common applications like style transfer, image synthesis, text generation, code generation, and data augmentation with guidance on implementation approaches and expected results.
