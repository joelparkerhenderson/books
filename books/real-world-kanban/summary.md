# Real-World Kanban, Second Edition

## Key Concepts

Real-World Kanban explores how organizations can achieve continuous improvement through Kanban and lean thinking principles applied to knowledge work. The book emphasizes visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, and optimizing for flow rather than following rigid frameworks. At its core, Kanban focuses on making work visible through boards, managing bottlenecks by setting WIP limits, and creating a culture where teams self-improve based on metrics like cycle time and cumulative flow diagrams. The approach shifts from episodic, plan-based development to continuous feedback loops that help teams respond to changing requirements while reducing friction and improving time to market.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is ideal for managers, team leads, and business leaders who want to improve their organization's efficiency without simply adopting prescriptive agile frameworks. Scrum masters looking for practical techniques to solve cross-team collaboration problems will find valuable guerrilla tactics, while senior managers can learn how to coach teams across the value chain. Developers working in agile environments who feel their improvements have stalled after the initial framework adoption will discover how to challenge the status quo and drive meaningful change. The case study format makes it particularly valuable for those who prefer learning from real-world examples rather than theoretical how-to recipes.

## Practical Applications

The book provides five detailed case studies showing how real companies used Kanban to solve specific problems including improving time to market by 2x, managing complex dependencies without team burnout, rescuing derailing projects by restoring trust, and applying lean thinking outside of IT in back-office operations. Teams can apply the patterns demonstrated across these stories to visualize their own workflows, identify and eliminate bottlenecks, and establish feedback mechanisms using hard data. The extensive appendix of Kanban board examples covers diverse contexts from product development and DevOps to marketing, sales, legal, and support teams, providing concrete starting points for organizations looking to implement their own systems. These patterns enable teams to move beyond scaling agile in IT and address end-to-end value delivery across entire organizations.
