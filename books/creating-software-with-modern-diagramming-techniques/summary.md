# Creating Software with Modern Diagramming Techniques

## Key Concepts

This book teaches creating effective software diagrams using modern text-based tools that version control friendly, automatable, and maintainable compared to traditional drag-and-drop diagram editors that create binary files becoming stale as code evolves. The central philosophy advocates for diagrams as code, using tools like PlantUML, Mermaid, Graphviz, and D2 that generate visual diagrams from text descriptions enabling developers to treat architecture documentation with the same rigor as source code through version control, code review, and continuous integration. Core concepts include choosing appropriate diagram types for different audiences and purposes whether C4 models for system context, sequence diagrams for interaction flows, or state machines for behavior modeling. The book emphasizes that diagrams serve communication not just documentation, with effective visuals conveying key insights quickly while avoiding overwhelming detail that clutters understanding or becomes impossible to maintain as systems change.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets software architects and senior developers responsible for communicating system design to technical and non-technical audiences who struggle with outdated diagrams in wikis disconnected from reality. Teams that abandon architecture diagrams because maintaining them in traditional tools requires too much effort will discover text-based approaches that generate visuals from descriptions stored alongside code, automatically updating as systems evolve. The content particularly benefits those preparing design documents, conducting architecture reviews, or onboarding new team members where clear visual communication accelerates understanding compared to prose descriptions alone. Developers who avoid creating diagrams due to complexity of traditional tools like Visio or architectural modeling suites will appreciate the simplicity of text-based formats resembling familiar DSLs, while teams practicing documentation-as-code will find these tools integrate naturally with existing workflows and toolchains.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to create C4 context diagrams showing system boundaries and external dependencies, container diagrams depicting major architectural components and their relationships, and component diagrams detailing internal structure of services or applications. The book demonstrates writing sequence diagrams illustrating request flows through distributed systems, generating entity-relationship diagrams documenting database schemas from schema definitions, and creating deployment diagrams showing how containers map to infrastructure. Practical examples cover using PlantUML's comprehensive diagram types from activity diagrams to timing diagrams, leveraging Mermaid's simpler syntax for embedding diagrams in Markdown documents, and applying Graphviz for custom graph layouts when standard diagram types don't fit. Advanced techniques include automating diagram generation from source code through static analysis extracting actual dependencies rather than intended ones, embedding diagrams in documentation sites that rebuild automatically on code changes, and versioning diagrams alongside code for reviewing architectural decisions through history. The book provides guidance on choosing tools based on team preferences and existing infrastructure, establishing conventions for diagram style and level of detail, and knowing when hand-drawn sketches communicate better than formal diagrams for exploratory design conversations versus detailed documentation requiring precision and maintenance.
