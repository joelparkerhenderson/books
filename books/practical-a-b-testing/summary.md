# Practical A/B Testing

## Key Concepts

This book presents A/B testing as an essential methodology for measuring the impact of product changes through controlled experiments rather than relying on assumptions or opinions, using data-driven insights to validate feature ideas before full deployment. The core framework teaches creating clear hypotheses that predict how changes will affect key metrics, establishing baselines to measure improvement against, and defining test and control variants that isolate the impact of specific changes. The content distinguishes between superiority tests proving a change is better, non-inferiority tests showing a change is not worse while potentially reducing costs, and equivalence tests demonstrating two approaches perform similarly. Advanced concepts include proxy metrics when direct measurement is impractical, holdback tests validating long-term impact beyond initial experiments, and degradation holdbacks ensuring changes don't harm metrics over time despite initial positive results.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book serves product managers, engineers, and team leaders who want to adopt data-driven decision making but lack experience implementing A/B testing infrastructure and culture within their organizations. Teams accustomed to launching changes directly to production without validation will discover systematic methods for measuring impact, understanding which improvements actually delight users versus assumptions that seem good but fail in practice. The content particularly benefits those in organizations resistant to experimentation, providing strategies for overcoming cultural barriers where stakeholders demand certainty before trying new approaches or fear admitting failed experiments. Engineers building personalization features, recommendation systems, or user interface optimizations will appreciate the practical CableMax narrative drawn from real experience at Comcast, showing how A/B testing enabled a For You homepage despite initial organizational skepticism through demonstrated user insights and metric improvements.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to structure experiments by creating hypotheses stating expected metric impacts, selecting primary metrics like engagement or conversion alongside guardrail metrics preventing unintended harm, and calculating sample sizes ensuring statistically confident results within reasonable timeframes. The book demonstrates implementing audience segmentation to test features on specific user groups, building infrastructure for variant assignment and metric tracking, and visualizing results through dashboards that communicate findings to stakeholders clearly. Practical guidance covers data wrangling techniques for cleaning and preparing experiment data, creating accessible data pipelines that enable analysis without deep technical knowledge, and designing visualizations that highlight significant findings while avoiding misleading interpretations. Cultural change strategies include shifting team perspectives to embrace experimentation, rolling out A/B testing gradually starting with low-risk features, and dispelling the failed experiment myth by reframing all results as valuable learning. The final chapters address build versus buy decisions for A/B testing platforms, weighing custom solutions offering tight integration against third-party tools providing faster deployment, and extending platforms with advanced features like multi-armed bandits or sequential testing as sophistication grows.
