# Building Table Views with Phoenix LiveView

## Key Concepts

Building Table Views with Phoenix LiveView focuses on creating advanced, interactive table user interfaces using Phoenix LiveView and Elixir. The book demonstrates how to build production-ready table features including sorting, filtering, pagination, and infinity scrolling while leveraging LiveView's real-time capabilities. Through the development of the Meerkat Observation Warden demo application, readers learn to organize database operations using query composition, work with LiveComponents and Ecto schemaless changesets to parse user input, and execute performance-heavy operations directly in the database. The book emphasizes practical implementation patterns that allow users to share their data views via URL, making the application both powerful and user-friendly.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is ideal for Elixir developers who understand the basics of Phoenix LiveView and want to master building sophisticated data display interfaces. It targets developers who need to present large datasets in web applications and want to avoid performance issues while providing users with powerful data exploration capabilities. Whether you're building admin panels, data dashboards, or any application that requires advanced table functionality, this book provides the specific techniques and patterns needed to create professional-grade table interfaces. The concise format makes it particularly valuable for developers who want focused, practical guidance without extensive theoretical discussion.

## Practical Applications

Readers will gain immediately applicable skills for building interactive tables that handle real-world data challenges. The book provides complete implementations for common requirements like enabling users to sort columns in ascending or descending order, filter data based on various criteria, and navigate through large datasets with traditional pagination or modern infinity scrolling. The techniques demonstrated apply directly to scenarios such as building admin interfaces for managing database records, creating dashboards that display analytics data, or developing any application where users need to explore and manipulate tabular information efficiently. The emphasis on LiveView integration means developers can build these features with minimal JavaScript while maintaining excellent user experience and performance.
