### Key concepts

AI for Everyday IT focuses on using AI tools to enhance management effectiveness across intervention strategies, team dynamics, and hiring processes, emphasizing that AI prompts complement rather than replace human judgment and decision-making. The book provides structured AI-assisted approaches to handle unpredictable management challenges including performance issues, team cohesion problems, and candidate evaluation, requiring mental energy, thorough documentation, and compassionate understanding while maintaining clear communication. Core themes include leveraging AI for creating compliant documentation from memos to performance improvement plans, using sentiment analysis to navigate team dynamics and individual sensitivities, and systematic tracking through AI-generated templates and dashboards that add structure and visual appeal to challenging management topics. The methodology integrates AI capabilities for bias checking, compliance review, feedback compilation, and emotional tone analysis while maintaining that managers should genuinely try to help employees improve rather than using PIPs as exit strategies. Success depends on clarity, support, realistic goals, and creating environments where team members feel genuinely valued and connected through honest feedback and meaningful recognition.

### Who should read it and why

This book targets technical managers, team leads, and IT professionals responsible for managing people and teams who want to leverage AI assistance for complex interpersonal challenges. Readers should be managers dealing with diverse personalities, team dynamics, performance issues, or integration of new team members, and those seeking to master time management while maintaining healthy team environments. The material assumes readers have management experience and understand the importance of documentation, compliance, and communication, but want to enhance their effectiveness through AI-powered tools and prompts. It appeals to those managing remote and hybrid teams where building connections and obtaining honest feedback presents special challenges, and managers who recognize that despite their experience, tough decisions can be made easier when properly organized and presented. The book benefits both new managers looking for structured approaches to sensitive situations and experienced leaders wanting to augment their existing skills with modern AI capabilities.

### Practical applications

The book provides immediately usable prompt templates for generating professional memos, warnings, and write-ups that ensure compliance with HR and legal standards while maintaining consistency and objectivity. Readers learn to create Excel dashboards for tracking performance improvement plans that visualize employee progress and systematically document incidents and feedback, with AI providing 90% of the structure for rapid customization. Practical applications include designing anonymous feedback systems with sentiment analysis to understand team morale, creating team cohesion surveys with calculators to transform feedback into measurable metrics, and developing recognition systems that foster belonging. The material demonstrates using AI to predict PIP success likelihood based on attendance patterns and performance history, generate constructive feedback using Situation-Action-Impact models, and design team-building activities tailored to team interests and weaknesses including DiSC profile assessments for understanding working styles. Advanced applications cover creating interview frameworks that reduce bias, developing comprehensive candidate evaluation scorecards, and organizing feedback loops with automated calendar integration, all supported by downloadable templates and examples that managers can immediately adapt to their specific workplace situations.
