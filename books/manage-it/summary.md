# Manage It! - Summary

## Key Concepts

This book provides a comprehensive risk-based approach to software project management emphasizing pragmatic decision-making over prescriptive best practices. The central framework involves identifying project drivers, constraints, and floats to understand what truly matters for success rather than trying to optimize the traditional iron triangle of cost, scope, and schedule. The book covers the complete project lifecycle from chartering through defining what done means, selecting appropriate life cycles from waterfall to agile based on project characteristics, creating realistic schedules using techniques like rolling-wave planning and inch-pebble estimates, steering projects with meaningful metrics displayed on dashboards, and managing the human aspects including team formation, meetings, and multisite coordination. Rothman emphasizes that software's ephemeral nature makes it harder to manage than tangible products, requiring visibility techniques like frequent integration, demos, and measurements to understand true project status rather than relying on status reports alone.

## Who Should Read It and Why

Software project managers responsible for delivering products will benefit from the practical guidance on navigating competing demands from stakeholders while keeping projects on track, especially those dealing with unclear requirements, tight deadlines, or limited resources. Technical leads and team members who want to understand project management perspectives to collaborate more effectively with their managers will gain insight into why certain decisions get made and how to provide useful project information. Senior managers and executives overseeing multiple projects need the portfolio management and program management sections to make informed decisions about resource allocation and project prioritization across the organization. The book serves both experienced project managers seeking to refine their approach and newcomers learning the profession, with real-world stories illustrating common challenges like schedule games, overconstrained projects, and stakeholder negotiations that theory alone cannot teach.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to create effective project charters that define success criteria and prevent scope creep by establishing clear boundaries and release criteria before coding begins. The book demonstrates choosing appropriate lifecycles including iterative, incremental, or evolutionary approaches based on whether requirements are clear, how much technical risk exists, and how frequently customers need feedback. Project managers will master scheduling techniques like using rolling-wave plans for near-term work, creating inch-pebble sized tasks visible within a day or two, and avoiding common schedule games like Hope Is Our Most Important Strategy and Queen of Denial. The dashboard chapter shows building visual management tools that display velocity trends, defect discovery rates, and other leading indicators that reveal project health more accurately than earned value or percent complete. Practical guidance covers managing distributed teams across time zones, integrating testing throughout development rather than as a final phase, running effective meetings that respect participant time, and completing projects with retrospectives that capture organizational learning for future improvements.
