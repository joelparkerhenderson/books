## Summary

Companies everywhere are moving everyday business processes over to the cloud, and AI is increasingly being given the reins in these tasks. As this massive digital transformation continues, the combination of serverless computing and AI promises to become the de facto standard for business-to-consumer platform development—and developers who can design, develop, implement, and maintain these systems will be in high demand! AI as a Service is a practical handbook to building and implementing serverless AI applications, without bogging you down with a lot of theory. Instead, you’ll find easy-to-digest instruction and two complete hands-on serverless AI builds in this must-have guide!

## About the technology

Cloud-based AI services can automate a variety of labor intensive business tasks in areas such as customer service, data analysis, and financial reporting. The secret is taking advantage of pre-built tools like Amazon Rekognition for image analysis or AWS Comprehend for natural language processing. That way, there’s no need to build expensive custom software. Artificial Intelligence (AI), a machine’s ability to learn and make predictions based on patterns it identifies, is already being leveraged by businesses around the world in areas like targeted product recommendations, financial forecasting and resource planning, customer service chatbots, healthcare diagnostics, data security, and more.

With the exciting combination of serverless computing and AI, software developers now have enormous power to improve their businesses’ existing systems and rapidly deploy new AI-enabled platforms. And to get on this fast-moving train, you don’t have to invest loads of time and effort in becoming a data scientist or AI expert, thanks to cloud platforms and the readily available off-the-shelf cloud-based AI services!

## About the book

AI as a Service is a fast-paced guide to harnessing the power of cloud-based solutions. You’ll learn to build real-world apps—such as chatbots and text-to-speech services—by stitching together cloud components. Work your way from small projects to large data-intensive applications.

## Key concepts

AI as a Service combines two commoditizing technologies—serverless computing and artificial intelligence services—to create a new standard for platform development without requiring deep AI expertise or managing infrastructure. Serverless computing represents true utility cloud computing where providers dynamically manage underlying resources through Functions-as-a-Service and managed services, creating abstractions that eliminate infrastructure management burden while charging only for actual usage rather than idle resources. The book frames effective AI as a Service engineering around four pillars: architecture for serverless patterns, development tools and techniques, understanding available machine learning and data services to solve business problems, and operations for production deployment and management. Major cloud providers now offer commoditized AI services for image recognition, natural language processing, speech processing, chatbots, and recommendations, allowing developers to build AI-enabled features without data science teams or custom model training. The paradigm shift transforms how businesses digitize manual processes by replacing human-driven workflows with cloud-native AI platforms that optimize decisions through connecting existing cloud services rather than building custom solutions.

## Who should read it and why

This book targets full stack and back-end developers who must implement AI-enhanced platforms and services, along with solution architects and product owners seeking to understand how AI can augment existing systems, and DevOps professionals wanting to learn the serverless approach to building and deploying applications. Readers do not need to be AI or machine learning experts since the focus is on using off-the-shelf cloud AI services rather than training custom models, making it accessible to engineers who need practical results quickly without getting stuck in theoretical details. The material assumes general software development experience and understanding of basic cloud computing concepts, positioning itself as an engineer's guide to rapidly produce results by leveraging managed AI services from AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. It appeals to those recognizing that within the next few years, serverless architectures and AI services will become standard enterprise toolkit components, and who want to get ahead by understanding how to compose systems from cloud services to achieve specific business goals without managing low-level infrastructure.

## Practical applications

The book provides hands-on guidance through building concrete systems, starting with rapidly constructing a serverless image recognition system using off-the-shelf technology that readers can deploy and experiment with to explore practical applications. Readers learn to build and secure serverless web applications, add AI-driven interfaces including speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and conversational chatbots, and apply effective development practices for project structure, continuous integration and deployment, and observability in serverless environments. The material covers applying serverless AI to existing legacy platforms through generic integration patterns and point solutions, including examples like optimizing hotel room pricing by ingesting local event data, using AI to interpret scraped information, and automatically publishing computed optimal rates. Advanced chapters demonstrate gathering data at scale with serverless web crawlers and extracting value from large datasets using AI services, showing how to connect cloud-native services to digitize manual business processes that humans currently run using spreadsheets or local databases. Throughout, the book emphasizes composing solutions from managed services to maximize business value with minimum effort, leading to increased developer productivity, feature velocity, and more scalable, resilient applications built on cloud provider shoulders.
