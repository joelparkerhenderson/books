### Key concepts

Zero to AI provides perspective on artificial intelligence's evolution from the 1956 Dartmouth summer research through two AI winters to today's machine learning revolution, emphasizing that modern AI success stems from data availability, cheap computing power, and the shift from explicit programming to learning from examples. The book distinguishes between narrow AI that solves single well-defined tasks and general AI that would match human capabilities across all domains, with current applications exclusively in the narrow category despite public misconceptions. Core concepts include the AI effect where technologies lose the "AI" label once commonplace, the definition of AI as software solving problems without explicit instruction focusing on outcomes rather than techniques, and machine learning as the engine powering today's explosion by enabling computers to learn autonomously from data. The material emphasizes dollar density of data as the metric for prioritizing AI applications, with core business data having direct impact on top or bottom lines deserving first attention, and distinguishes structured data fitting into spreadsheet rows and columns from unstructured formats like images and text requiring different processing approaches.

### Who should read it and why

This book targets business professionals, product managers, and organizational leaders wanting to understand AI principles to productively use the technology without becoming programmers, requiring no coding expertise but benefiting from understanding technical concepts for effective team communication. The material appeals to those frustrated by AI hype and confusion between AI, machine learning, and data science terminology, seeking clear working definitions that avoid narrow focus on flashy applications that lose relevance as technology evolves. Readers should be decision-makers tasked with bringing transformative AI into their organizations who need to spot opportunities, avoid impossible projects, and identify low-hanging fruit without solid understanding of underlying principles. The book suits nontechnical people who recognize that learning AI's nuts and bolts prevents dreaming about unb

uildable projects while missing easily tackled opportunities, and professionals managing technical teams who need sufficient vocabulary to plan and manage AI efforts without implementing code themselves. It provides Harvard Business School case method-inspired real-world business examples from companies like Google achieving 40% cooling bill cuts and Square creating $3 billion loan business lines, encouraging readers to develop their own analytical takes before reviewing provided insights.

### Practical applications

The book teaches recognizing core business data through dollar density metrics, identifying whether information has direct impact on organizational performance like e-commerce orders, financial transactions, patient records, or cooling system measurements rather than peripheral metrics like website visits. Readers learn distinguishing structured data fitting Excel-like formats from unstructured content, understanding that same information can exist in both forms as illustrated by medical diagnoses represented as prose versus tabulated fields. Practical applications use the FutureHouse fictional real estate marketplace as recurring example demonstrating supervised learning for predicting key information, comparing machine learning to conventional software engineering, and understanding when learning from examples beats explicit rule specification. The material covers how data science projects producing static reports and insights differ from live AI software running continuously, helping readers position their initiatives appropriately and set realistic expectations. Case studies demonstrate using behavioral signals and transaction data to create entirely new business lines through automated processes achieving exceptional performance metrics like Square's 4% delinquency rates and one-day loan deposits. Throughout, the approach prioritizes teaching through data types as organizing principle, showing readers how to spot valuable data in their organizations, determine applicable techniques, and fit discoveries into broader AI landscape while avoiding technology implementation details that rapidly become obsolete.
