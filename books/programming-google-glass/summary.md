# Programming Google Glass

## Key Concepts

This book introduces developing applications for Google Glass wearable computer featuring head-mounted display showing information within user's field of vision, controlled through voice commands and touchpad gestures enabling hands-free interaction. The core Glass platform combines Android basics with unique interaction models optimized for glanceable information and ambient computing, where applications provide timely contextual information without requiring explicit user attention. Key concepts include understanding Timeline as the primary UI paradigm organizing content into chronological cards users swipe through, designing for voice input using natural language commands rather than typing, and embracing micro-interactions where applications surface information briefly then get out of the way. The book covers Mirror API for server-side applications pushing Timeline cards to Glass through REST endpoints versus GDK for native Android applications running directly on device with full sensor and camera access, with appropriate choice depending on application requirements around offline functionality, real-time response, or battery constraints.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets Android developers curious about wearable computing wanting to understand how familiar mobile development translates to head-mounted displays, early adopters exploring Glass potential beyond consumer skepticism focusing on professional use cases like medical, industrial, or field service applications, and developers interested in augmented reality seeing Glass as platform for overlaying digital information onto physical world. Those who dismissed Glass as failed consumer product will discover continued professional applications where hands-free operation provides genuine utility surgeons accessing patient data during procedures or warehouse workers scanning inventory without interrupting flow. The content particularly benefits mobile developers wanting to expand expertise into wearable computing before broader adoption, learning design patterns for constrained interfaces and ambient computing differentiating wearables from smartphones.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to build Mirror API applications authenticating with Google servers then pushing Timeline cards displayed as notifications on Glass, implement voice commands triggering application actions through custom vocabulary, and handle user responses through menu actions or voice replies returned to server. The book demonstrates creating native GDK applications accessing device sensors like accelerometer for gesture detection, implementing camera applications capturing photos or video hands-free useful for documentation, and building location-aware applications providing contextual information based on where user is looking. Practical examples cover designing appropriate information density avoiding cluttered displays in small screen real estate, implementing audio feedback for eyes-free interactions, and managing battery life carefully since Glass constrained by size has limited capacity. Advanced patterns include using card bundles for related information users can swipe between, implementing live cards showing updating information like navigation directions or sensor readings, and creating immersive experiences taking full screen for games or augmented reality applications. The book provides design guidelines specific to head-mounted displays avoiding motion sickness through careful animation choices, privacy considerations around recording capabilities requiring clear indicators, and distribution through Google's curated Glassware approval process ensuring quality and appropriateness for platform.
