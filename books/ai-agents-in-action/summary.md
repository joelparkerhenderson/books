### Key concepts

AI Agents in Action focuses on building autonomous systems that can perceive environments, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals, distinguishing reactive agents from deliberative agents with planning capabilities and hybrid architectures combining both approaches. The book covers agent architectures including the perception-action cycle, belief-desire-intention models, and multi-agent systems where agents coordinate, compete, or collaborate to solve complex problems. Core technical concepts include reinforcement learning for training agents through rewards, search algorithms for planning action sequences, and communication protocols for multi-agent coordination including auctions, negotiations, and shared knowledge bases.

### Who should read it and why

This book targets ML engineers, robotics developers, and software architects building systems that need autonomous decision-making capabilities beyond simple request-response patterns. Readers should have programming experience and basic understanding of machine learning, though deep RL expertise is not required as concepts are built up progressively. The material appeals to those developing game AI, robotic systems, trading algorithms, smart home automation, or any application requiring agents that adapt behavior based on changing environments and learned experience.

### Practical applications

The book provides implementation patterns for agent-based systems including environment modeling, reward shaping for RL training, action selection strategies, and state representation design. Readers learn building blocks like pathfinding algorithms, decision trees, finite state machines, and behavior trees for agent control, along with techniques for debugging agent behavior and visualizing decision processes. Practical examples cover multi-agent scenarios including cooperative task completion, competitive games, emergent behavior in swarm systems, and hybrid approaches combining learned and programmed behaviors for robustness.
