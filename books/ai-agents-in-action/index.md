- Enhance agents with speech and vision capabilities

You won't find toy examples or fragile assistants that require constant supervision. AI Agents in Action teaches you to build trustworthy AI capable of handling high-stakes negotiations. You'll master prompt engineering to create agents with distinct personas and profiles, and develop multi-agent collaborations that thrive in unpredictable environments. Beyond just learning a new technology, you'll discover a transformative approach to problem-solving.

## About the technology

Most production AI systems require many orchestrated interactions between the user, AI models, and a wide variety of data sources. AI agents capture and organize these interactions into autonomous components that can process information, make decisions, and learn from interactions behind the scenes. This book will show you how to create AI agents and connect them together into powerful multi-agent systems.

## About the book

In AI Agents in Action, you’ll learn how to build production-ready assistants, multi-agent systems, and behavioral agents. You’ll master the essential parts of an agent, including retrieval-augmented knowledge and memory, while you create multi-agent applications that can use software tools, plan tasks autonomously, and learn from experience. As you explore the many interesting examples, you’ll work with state-of-the-art tools like OpenAI Assistants API, GPT Nexus, LangChain, Prompt Flow, AutoGen, and CrewAI.

## AI summary

### Key concepts

AI Agents in Action focuses on building autonomous systems that can perceive environments, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals, distinguishing reactive agents from deliberative agents with planning capabilities and hybrid architectures combining both approaches. The book covers agent architectures including the perception-action cycle, belief-desire-intention models, and multi-agent systems where agents coordinate, compete, or collaborate to solve complex problems. Core technical concepts include reinforcement learning for training agents through rewards, search algorithms for planning action sequences, and communication protocols for multi-agent coordination including auctions, negotiations, and shared knowledge bases.

### Who should read it and why

This book targets ML engineers, robotics developers, and software architects building systems that need autonomous decision-making capabilities beyond simple request-response patterns. Readers should have programming experience and basic understanding of machine learning, though deep RL expertise is not required as concepts are built up progressively. The material appeals to those developing game AI, robotic systems, trading algorithms, smart home automation, or any application requiring agents that adapt behavior based on changing environments and learned experience.

### Practical applications

The book provides implementation patterns for agent-based systems including environment modeling, reward shaping for RL training, action selection strategies, and state representation design. Readers learn building blocks like pathfinding algorithms, decision trees, finite state machines, and behavior trees for agent control, along with techniques for debugging agent behavior and visualizing decision processes. Practical examples cover multi-agent scenarios including cooperative task completion, competitive games, emergent behavior in swarm systems, and hybrid approaches combining learned and programmed behaviors for robustness.
