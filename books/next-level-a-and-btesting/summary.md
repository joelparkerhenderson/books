# Next-Level A/B Testing

## Key Concepts

Next-Level A/B Testing advances beyond basic experimentation fundamentals to focus on improving three critical dimensions of testing programs: rate, quality, and cost. The book introduces sophisticated strategies including multi-armed bandits for dynamic allocation, sequential testing for early stopping decisions, CUPED for variance reduction, stratified sampling for precision improvements, interleaving for ranking system evaluation, and meta-analysis for aggregating results across experiments. It addresses real-world constraints like limited testing availability through techniques such as varying testing strategies, managing interaction effects, and leveraging adaptive methods that balance exploration and exploitation. The content emphasizes practical implementation considerations including platform requirements, engineering team capabilities, and balancing complexity against usability to ensure teams can actually adopt these advanced techniques rather than just understanding them theoretically.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is essential for product managers, software engineers, data scientists, business analysts, and engineering managers who already run A/B tests regularly and want to scale their experimentation programs more effectively. Readers should have experience with basic A/B testing concepts including hypothesis formation, metrics definition, and variant design, making the companion book Practical A/B Testing a recommended prerequisite for newcomers. The book is particularly valuable for teams facing bottlenecks in their experimentation velocity, struggling with inconclusive results due to insufficient statistical power, or looking to reduce the operational costs of long-running experiments. Data scientists will find practical guidance on enabling advanced statistical methods within platforms, while product managers will learn how to make strategic decisions about which techniques to prioritize based on organizational constraints and user impact considerations.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to conduct experimentation workshops that identify rate, quality, and cost improvement opportunities within their organizations, implement multiple concurrent testing strategies including layered experiments and partial overlaps to increase throughput, design experiments with more sensitive metrics and appropriate capping techniques to reach significance faster, deploy long-term holdbacks and post-period analysis to measure sustained impact beyond short-term metrics, verify experiment configurations through canaries and A/A tests to catch implementation errors before full deployment, prevent false positives through multiple testing corrections and appropriate statistical power calculations, and leverage machine learning evaluation techniques including offline metrics, multi-armed bandits, and interleaving for rapid model iteration. The book provides decision frameworks for evaluating when to invest in each strategy, worksheets for assessing current experimentation maturity, and cautionary tales that illustrate common pitfalls like invalidated holdbacks, misconfigured experiments, and overreliance on statistical significance without considering practical significance.
