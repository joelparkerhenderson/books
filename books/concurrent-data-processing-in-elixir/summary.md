# Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir

## Key Concepts

Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir explores how to leverage the Erlang Virtual Machine's exceptional concurrency model to build fast, resilient, and scalable data processing systems. The book progresses through increasingly sophisticated concurrency abstractions, starting with the Task module for simple parallel work, advancing to GenServer for stateful long-running processes with supervision trees, then covering GenStage for back-pressured data pipelines, Flow for high-level concurrent collection processing inspired by Apache Spark, and culminating with Broadway for production-ready data ingestion from external systems. Each tool builds upon the previous ones while serving distinct use cases, from basic parallelization to complex multi-stage processing topologies. The content emphasizes understanding when to use each approach, how to design supervision strategies that follow the "let it crash" philosophy, and how to implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is targeted at intermediate Elixir developers who are comfortable writing basic Elixir code but want to master the concurrency features that make the language exceptional for data-intensive applications. It's particularly valuable for developers building systems that process large volumes of data, whether that's web applications handling high throughput, embedded systems with Nerves, data analytics platforms, event processing systems, or any application running on multi-core hardware that needs to maximize performance. Developers transitioning from sequential programming paradigms or those familiar with concurrency models in other languages will gain deep insights into the unique advantages of the BEAM's process model. The book is essential for anyone who wants to move beyond basic OTP knowledge and learn how to architect systems that can handle increasing workloads while remaining stable and maintainable.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to build job processing systems with worker pools managed by DynamicSupervisor and coordinated through the Registry, create multi-stage data processing pipelines that automatically handle back-pressure to prevent system overload, parallelize collection processing tasks to leverage multiple CPU cores efficiently, implement resilient data ingestion systems that consume from message queues or streaming platforms, design supervision trees that isolate failures and enable graceful recovery, choose appropriate dispatchers for different workflow patterns, batch messages for efficient downstream processing, and test concurrent systems to ensure correct behavior under load. The book includes practical examples like processing CSV files with Flow, building ticket processing systems with Broadway, implementing GenStage producers and consumers, and structuring applications that can recover from crashes without data loss. These skills directly apply to building production systems for data analytics, real-time event processing, IoT data collection, API aggregation, and any scenario requiring high-performance concurrent data transformation.
