### Key concepts

Regular Expression Puzzles and AI Coding combines learning regex pattern matching through engaging puzzles with leveraging AI coding assistants to accelerate regex development and debugging. The book covers regex fundamentals including character classes, quantifiers, anchors, groups, and lookarounds while demonstrating how AI tools can suggest patterns, explain complex regex, generate test cases, and help debug matching issues. Core principles include building regex skills through progressive challenges, using AI to explore multiple solution approaches and understand tradeoffs, and developing intuition for when regex is appropriate versus when parsing libraries or other tools provide better solutions.

### Who should read it and why

This book targets developers, data engineers, and technical professionals who regularly work with text processing and want to master regex while learning to leverage AI assistance effectively. Readers should have basic programming experience but need not be regex experts, with the puzzle-based approach making learning engaging for those who struggled with traditional regex tutorials. The material appeals to those doing log file analysis, data extraction, input validation, or text transformation who want efficient regex skills augmented by modern AI tools.

### Practical applications

The book provides progressively challenging regex puzzles covering real-world scenarios including log parsing, data validation, text extraction from unstructured sources, and pattern matching in code. Readers learn effective strategies for using AI to draft initial regex patterns, refining AI suggestions through testing, generating comprehensive test cases including edge cases, and debugging complex patterns. The material covers practical considerations like regex performance optimization, choosing between regex and alternative text processing approaches, building maintainable regex with comments and documentation, and integrating AI-assisted regex development into professional workflows for rapid, reliable text processing solutions.
