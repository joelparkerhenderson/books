# HTML5 and CSS3

## Key Concepts

This book teaches developers how to use emerging HTML5 and CSS3 standards while maintaining backward compatibility with older browsers through progressive enhancement and graceful degradation strategies. The content distinguishes between HTML5 as a formal specification and HTML5 as a broader platform encompassing related technologies like geolocation, canvas, and local storage. Core topics include new semantic structural tags like header, footer, nav, and article that replace meaningless div elements, advanced form inputs for email, URL, and date that provide built-in validation, and CSS3 features like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, and web fonts that eliminate image-based workarounds. The book emphasizes building accessible interfaces using ARIA roles and landmarks, creating responsive designs with media queries for mobile devices, and leveraging client-side storage and offline capabilities for richer applications.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book serves web developers comfortable with traditional HTML and CSS who want to adopt modern standards without abandoning users on older browsers. Frontend developers tired of JavaScript hacks for basic features like rounded corners or form validation will discover native browser capabilities that simplify development while improving performance and accessibility. The progressive enhancement approach particularly benefits teams working on projects that must support diverse browser populations, teaching techniques for delivering enhanced experiences to modern browsers while maintaining functionality for legacy systems. Developers building mobile-first responsive designs will appreciate the practical guidance on media queries and touch-friendly interfaces, while those creating data-rich applications will benefit from chapters on canvas for dynamic graphics, video and audio embedding without plugins, and client-side storage for offline functionality.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to structure blog layouts using semantic HTML5 tags with appropriate fallbacks for Internet Explorer, create custom data attributes for JavaScript interaction without polluting markup, and implement autofocus, placeholder text, and content editable features with polyfills for unsupported browsers. The book demonstrates styling tables with nth-child pseudoclass selectors, generating print-specific content with CSS :after, and creating multicolumn layouts without complex float-based techniques. Practical examples cover drawing logos and charts on HTML5 canvas using libraries like RGraph, embedding audio and video with fallback formats for different browser codec support, and adding rounded corners, drop shadows, and gradient backgrounds using pure CSS. Advanced topics include implementing localStorage for user preferences persistence, building offline web applications with application cache manifests, integrating geolocation for location-aware features, and communicating across domains with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and postMessage APIs.
