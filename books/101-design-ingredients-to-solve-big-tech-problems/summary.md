# 101 Design Ingredients to Solve Big Tech Problems

## Key Concepts

This book presents a catalog of reusable design patterns, architectural components, and engineering techniques that experienced engineers apply when building large-scale distributed systems, serving as a reference for common solutions to recurring problems in modern software architecture. The core philosophy treats system design as combining proven ingredients like caching layers, message queues, load balancers, and circuit breakers rather than inventing from scratch, with success coming from understanding each component's trade-offs and appropriate applications. Key concepts span distributed system fundamentals including CAP theorem guiding consistency-availability-partition tolerance choices, eventual consistency strategies for scaling beyond single database constraints, and partitioning schemes distributing data across multiple nodes. The book emphasizes that no single solution fits all contexts, requiring engineers to evaluate ingredients based on specific requirements around scale, latency, consistency, and complexity rather than following universal best practices.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn when to apply caching at different levels from CDNs and reverse proxies to application and database caches, how to implement rate limiting protecting services from overload, and when to choose between synchronous request-response versus asynchronous message-driven architectures. The book demonstrates using load balancers with various algorithms from round-robin to consistent hashing for distributing requests, implementing circuit breakers preventing cascade failures, and applying backpressure mechanisms managing system overload gracefully. Practical ingredients cover database scaling through read replicas, sharding strategies, and choosing between SQL and NoSQL based on query patterns and consistency needs. Advanced patterns include implementing distributed transactions with two-phase commit or saga patterns, using event sourcing for audit trails and temporal queries, and applying CQRS separating read and write models for independent scaling. The book provides decision trees for selecting appropriate ingredients, anti-patterns showing common misapplications, and real-world examples from major tech companies demonstrating these patterns at massive scale in production systems.
