# Deliver Audacious Web Apps with Ember 2

## Key Concepts

Deliver Audacious Web Apps with Ember 2 teaches developers to build ambitious single-page applications using Ember's convention-over-configuration philosophy that emphasizes developer ergonomics and productivity. The book explores Ember's core architecture including the router for managing application state and URLs, routes for loading data and handling transitions, templates powered by Handlebars for declaring user interfaces, and components for creating reusable UI widgets with encapsulated behavior. It demonstrates how Ember Data provides a sophisticated abstraction for working with RESTful APIs including adapters for customizing HTTP requests, serializers for transforming JSON payloads, and models that define data structures and relationships. The content covers advanced patterns including dependency injection for sharing services across the application, mixins for code reuse, utilities for common functions, and custom transforms for data type conversion, all while emphasizing how Ember CLI streamlines project creation, code generation, building, testing, and deployment through a unified command-line interface.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is intended for web developers who have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and understand concepts like the DOM, Ajax, and RESTful services, but who may be new to Ember or coming from other frameworks like React or AngularJS. It's particularly valuable for developers tired of writing boilerplate code and glue logic for common web application patterns like routing, data fetching, and state management, as Ember provides opinionated solutions that let developers focus on features rather than infrastructure. The book serves teams building complex web applications that require sophisticated client-side routing, real-time data synchronization, and maintainable code organization across large codebases. Anyone frustrated with the fragmentation of the JavaScript ecosystem will appreciate Ember's cohesive approach where the router, data layer, and view layer work seamlessly together through well-defined conventions.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to scaffold new Ember applications with Ember CLI and generate routes, components, models, and tests with simple commands, design routing hierarchies with nested routes that map URLs to application states and enable bookmarkable views, create templates that automatically update when underlying data changes through Ember's two-way data binding, build reusable components that encapsulate markup and behavior for UI patterns like forms, lists, and cards, integrate with backend APIs by defining models with attributes and relationships that Ember Data manages automatically, customize Ember Data's adapters and serializers to work with non-standard APIs that don't follow REST conventions exactly, implement authentication and authorization by injecting services into routes and components, write comprehensive tests including unit tests for business logic, integration tests for components, and acceptance tests for end-to-end workflows, deploy applications to production using Ember CLI's build pipeline that minifies assets and generates fingerprinted files, and extend functionality through Ember addons that package reusable code for distribution via npm. The book progressively builds an EmberNote application throughout, demonstrating these concepts in the context of a realistic note-taking application.
