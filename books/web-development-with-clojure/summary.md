# Web Development with Clojure

## Key Concepts

This book teaches building web applications using Clojure's functional programming approach with immutable data structures, emphasizing simplicity through composable libraries rather than monolithic frameworks. The core philosophy embraces Ring's simple request-response abstraction where handlers are pure functions transforming request maps to response maps, middleware composes cross-cutting concerns like session management or parameter parsing, and Compojure provides routing DSL matching URLs to handlers. Key concepts include leveraging Clojure's persistent data structures enabling safe concurrent access without locks, using Hiccup for representing HTML as Clojure data structures rather than string templates, and applying functional techniques like higher-order functions and composition for building maintainable applications. The book covers database access through clojure.java.jdbc or HugSQL providing functional wrappers around SQL, state management using atoms, refs, or agents for coordinating changes, and client-side development using ClojureScript compiling to JavaScript for full-stack Clojure applications.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets developers with functional programming interest wanting practical experience building real applications beyond toy examples, Clojure programmers comfortable with language basics seeking guidance on web-specific libraries and patterns, and web developers from imperative backgrounds curious how functional programming applies to familiar domain. Those frustrated by mutable state bugs in object-oriented web frameworks will discover how Clojure's immutability simplifies reasoning about application state and eliminates entire classes of concurrency errors. The content particularly benefits developers building APIs or data-driven applications where Clojure's data-centric approach and REPL-driven development provide rapid feedback cycles. Anyone who has navigated sprawling Rails or Django projects wondering whether simpler approaches exist will appreciate Clojure's philosophy of composing small focused libraries rather than adopting comprehensive frameworks making choices for you.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to set up Ring applications handling HTTP requests through simple function composition, define routes using Compojure mapping URLs to handlers with parameter extraction, and generate HTML using Hiccup avoiding string concatenation and escaping issues inherent in template languages. The book demonstrates database access using korma for DSL-based queries or HugSQL for SQL-in-files approach keeping queries separate from Clojure code, implement authentication and authorization using friend library, and manage sessions through middleware providing stateful interactions atop stateless HTTP. Practical examples cover building RESTful APIs returning JSON from Ring handlers, handling form submissions including validation using bouncer or similar libraries, and implementing file uploads managing multipart form data. Advanced topics include real-time features using WebSockets through http-kit or sente, deployment to platforms like Heroku with environment-specific configuration, and performance optimization through connection pooling and query optimization. The book provides guidance on project structure organizing code using namespaces, testing strategies leveraging Clojure's focus on pure functions simplifying unit testing, and ClojureScript for reactive user interfaces using libraries like Reagent wrapping React. Production topics cover logging using tools.logging, monitoring application health, and managing dependencies through Leiningen or tools.deps ensuring reproducible builds.
