# Create Your Successful Agile Project: Collaborate, Measure, Estimate, Deliver

## Key Concepts

Create Your Successful Agile Project provides a comprehensive framework for implementing agile and lean principles in software development teams and organizations. The book integrates agile's twelve principles with lean's two pillars of continuous improvement and respect for people, showing how iteration-based and flow-based agile approaches complement each other. It emphasizes building cross-functional, self-organizing teams that deliver value through features rather than tasks, using practices like rolling-wave roadmaps, small stories, and appropriate ranking strategies. The book covers essential agile mechanics including visualization with boards, various estimation techniques, defining "done," and measuring progress, while also addressing the human aspects of agile work such as building trust, creating safety, providing feedback, and servant leadership that enables teams to excel.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is essential for anyone involved in software development projects who wants to move beyond cargo-cult agile practices to genuine agile thinking. It's particularly valuable for project managers transitioning from traditional methodologies, developers who want to understand the full context of agile beyond their daily standups, product owners struggling to prioritize effectively, and organizational leaders considering or implementing agile transformations. The book serves both newcomers seeking foundational understanding and experienced practitioners looking to refine their approach or solve specific challenges. Its practical, pattern-based guidance makes it accessible without requiring deep theoretical knowledge, while providing enough depth to address real-world complexities that simpler treatments of agile ignore.

## Practical Applications

Readers learn to implement specific agile practices that immediately improve team performance and project outcomes. The book provides actionable guidance on forming effective teams with social contracts, running productive retrospectives and demonstrations, creating meaningful sprint boards and kanban systems, writing user stories that deliver value, and using velocity and cycle time to make realistic commitments. It addresses common challenges like managing technical debt, handling interruptions, coordinating multiple teams, and reporting progress to stakeholders. The techniques for estimation, ranking work by cost of delay, defining acceptance criteria, and measuring doneness help teams make better decisions about what to build and when to ship. The emphasis on sustainable pace, continuous improvement, and team empowerment provides a foundation for building high-performing agile teams that deliver quality software while maintaining developer happiness and preventing burnout.
