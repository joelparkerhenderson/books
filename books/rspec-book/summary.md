# The RSpec Book - Summary

Note: This appears to be a duplicate/alternate edition of "the-rspec-book" which already has a summary. This book covers behavior-driven development with RSpec and Cucumber, teaching developers to write executable specifications that drive development while serving as living documentation. It demonstrates the outside-in BDD cycle using Cucumber for acceptance tests and RSpec for unit-level specifications, emphasizing clear communication of behavior and intent.

Refer to the summary at: the-rspec-book/summary.md for full details.
