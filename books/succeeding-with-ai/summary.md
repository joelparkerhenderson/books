### Key concepts

Succeeding with AI requires bridging business and technology through the Sense/Analyze/React loop, which involves collecting data, performing AI analysis, and taking business actions based on the results. The book emphasizes that technical knowledge of AI algorithms alone is insufficient for business success, and that we are in the Age of Implementation where the focus should be on applying existing AI knowledge rather than making new scientific discoveries. The central thesis is that making money with AI follows the formula "Data + AI + CLUE = Profit," where CLUE represents the human insight needed to connect AI capabilities with viable business actions. The primary determinant of an AI project's success lies not in infrastructure choices or algorithm selection, but in how well you connect research questions to specific, actionable business outcomes.

### Who should read it and why

This book is written for business leaders and project managers who have successfully led software projects before and are now tasked with delivering results using AI. The reader should understand their organization's business model, have experience with business metrics, and be willing to facilitate conversations between technical and business teams, but they do not need a deep technical background in AI or mathematics. Data scientists interested in achieving business results will also find value in learning how to link technical capabilities with business needs. The book assumes readers can run general technical projects and understand basic AI concepts like data collection and algorithm training, but positions itself to help them avoid the common pitfall of treating AI as pure research rather than as a business implementation challenge.

### Practical applications

The book provides a systematic approach for identifying AI opportunities by starting with viable business actions rather than available technologies, illustrated through examples like automating medical diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. Readers learn to evaluate whether all components of the Sense/Analyze/React loop are technically and economically feasible before committing to a project, including assessing data collection costs, AI capability limitations, and the economic value of automated actions. The methodology is process-neutral and applicable to organizations of all sizes, teaching principles for linking business and technology, managing scarce resources, measuring success with appropriate metrics, and avoiding the trap of focusing on infrastructure choices before understanding the business value being created. The book helps leaders distinguish between critical success factors and nice-to-have elements, emphasizing that collaboration between business and technical teams is essential and that neither side can succeed in isolation.
