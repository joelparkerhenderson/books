# Fixing Your Scrum

## Key Concepts

This book diagnoses common dysfunctions in Scrum implementations where teams follow the rituals without achieving the intended benefits of agility, transparency, and continuous improvement that make Scrum valuable. The core philosophy emphasizes that Scrum serves as a framework exposing organizational impediments rather than hiding them through process overhead, requiring genuine commitment to addressing revealed problems instead of just performing ceremonies. Key concepts include the empirical process control pillars of transparency enabling honest conversation about progress, inspection creating feedback loops through reviews and retrospectives, and adaptation responding to learned information rather than rigidly following plans. The book addresses anti-patterns like mechanical Scrum where teams hold standups and planning meetings without meaningful collaboration, zombie Scrum that looks alive but delivers no value, and Scrumbut variations claiming Scrum membership while abandoning core principles when they become uncomfortable.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets Scrum Masters and agile coaches struggling with teams that resist change despite adopting Scrum terminology, product owners frustrated that iterative development hasn't improved time-to-market or stakeholder satisfaction, and development teams feeling burdened by process overhead without seeing promised benefits. Organizations that implemented Scrum through training workshops but see no improvement in delivery predictability or team morale will discover why superficial adoption fails and what genuine transformation requires. The content particularly benefits those in environments where Scrum became another layer of bureaucracy on top of existing command-and-control management, learning how to strip away cargo cult practices while preserving the framework's value. Teams experiencing planning theater where estimates disconnect from reality, retrospectives that identify problems never addressed, or sprints that end without potentially shippable increments will find diagnostic tools identifying root causes beyond blaming individuals or the framework itself.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to identify dysfunctions through symptoms like inconsistent sprint goals, team members working in isolation despite daily standups, and product backlogs containing technical tasks invisible to stakeholders rather than user-centric stories. The book demonstrates conducting retrospectives that generate actionable improvements actually implemented in subsequent sprints, facilitating sprint planning that produces realistic commitments teams believe in rather than imposed targets, and running effective sprint reviews where stakeholder feedback genuinely influences upcoming work. Practical guidance covers helping product owners create valuable increments each sprint by slicing features vertically rather than in horizontal technical layers, coaching teams to swarm on impediments blocking progress rather than accumulating blockers passively, and building trust with stakeholders through delivered working software demonstrating capability. Advanced strategies address organizational impediments beyond team control like dependencies on other groups blocking progress, executive pressure for detailed long-term plans conflicting with empirical adaptation, and cultures punishing transparency when teams honestly report obstacles or uncertainties preventing traditional status green reporting.
