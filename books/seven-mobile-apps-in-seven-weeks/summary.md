# Seven Mobile Apps in Seven Weeks

## Key Concepts

Seven Mobile Apps in Seven Weeks provides a comparative exploration of modern mobile development platforms by building seven different nontrivial applications across native and cross-platform tools. The book guides readers through building apps on mobile web, iOS with Swift, Android, Universal Windows Platform, and cross-platform frameworks including RubyMotion, Xamarin, and React Native. Each platform is explored through a three-day structured approach where readers build increasingly complex features while learning platform-specific idioms, tools, and development workflows. The book emphasizes understanding the similarities and differences between platforms rather than achieving comprehensive mastery, helping developers make informed decisions about which platform or approach best suits their needs. Common patterns explored across platforms include navigation, displaying collections of data, making HTTP requests to JSON APIs, handling different screen sizes and orientations, and local data storage.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book is ideal for software developers who want to explore mobile development without committing fully to a single platform before understanding the landscape. Experienced developers in other domains who need to quickly evaluate mobile options will appreciate the structured comparison across multiple platforms. Developers already proficient in one mobile platform can use this book to understand alternative approaches and expand their skillset. Technical leads and architects making platform decisions for teams will benefit from the practical hands-on experience with each option rather than relying solely on marketing materials. The book is particularly valuable for polyglot programmers who embrace learning new paradigms and tools as a way to improve their overall software development thinking.

## Practical Applications

Readers will build practical applications including a world clock web app using HTML5 and JavaScript, a weather forecast app for iOS, a currency conversion app for Android, a stock quote app for Windows, a to-do app that shares code across Android and iOS using RubyMotion, a calculator app using Xamarin with shared C# code, and a note-taking app with React Native. Each application teaches platform-specific concepts like iOS view controllers and Auto Layout, Android activities and fragments, Windows XAML and data binding, RubyMotion's Ruby syntax for mobile development, Xamarin Forms for cross-platform UI, and React Native's component-based architecture. By the end, readers will have hands-on experience with all major mobile platforms and be able to evaluate trade-offs between native development and cross-platform tools based on actual implementation experience rather than theoretical knowledge. The book includes guidance on setting up development environments, working with platform-specific tools and emulators, and integrating with backend APIs.
