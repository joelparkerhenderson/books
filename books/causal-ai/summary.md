### Key concepts

Causal AI moves beyond correlation to understanding cause-and-effect relationships, enabling prediction of intervention outcomes and answering "what if" questions that pure prediction models cannot address. The book covers causal inference frameworks including structural causal models, directed acyclic graphs for representing causal relationships, and techniques like randomized controlled trials, instrumental variables, and propensity score matching for identifying causal effects from observational data. Core concepts include confounding variables that create spurious correlations, the fundamental problem of causal inference where we cannot observe counterfactuals, and do-calculus for reasoning about interventions mathematically.

### Who should read it and why

This book targets data scientists, researchers, and analysts working in domains where understanding causation is critical including medicine, economics, policy, and business decision-making, requiring statistical knowledge and comfort with mathematical notation. The material appeals to those frustrated by prediction models that fail under distribution shifts or when used for decision-making, seeking rigorous frameworks for causal reasoning. Readers benefit from understanding when causal methods are necessary versus when prediction suffices, how to identify causal effects despite confounding, and designing data collection or experiments to answer causal questions.

### Practical applications

The book provides practical methods for drawing causal diagrams from domain knowledge, identifying testable implications of causal assumptions, and selecting appropriate causal inference techniques for available data. Readers learn estimating treatment effects from observational data, designing experiments to maximize causal information, testing causal hypotheses, and building robust causal models that generalize across environments. The material covers applications like A/B testing interpretation, policy impact evaluation, root cause analysis, and building decision-support systems that correctly predict intervention outcomes rather than just passive predictions.
