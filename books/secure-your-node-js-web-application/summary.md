# Secure Your Node.js Web Application

## Key Concepts

This book addresses security vulnerabilities common in Node.js web applications, teaching developers to identify and prevent attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and authentication bypass that compromise user data and system integrity. The core philosophy treats security as integral to development rather than afterthought, with defense-in-depth applying multiple layers of protection recognizing that no single control prevents all attacks. Key concepts include understanding OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and how they manifest in Node.js applications, implementing input validation and output encoding preventing injection attacks, and using security headers instructing browsers to enforce protection policies. The book covers authentication and authorization distinguishing between proving identity and controlling access, session management preventing fixation and hijacking attacks, and cryptography applying proper hashing for passwords and encryption for sensitive data. Modern security topics include defending against CSRF protecting state-changing operations from forged requests, implementing rate limiting preventing abuse and brute force attacks, and handling dependency vulnerabilities through monitoring and updates.

## Who Should Read It and Why

This book targets Node.js developers building web applications who understand framework basics but lack security expertise, security professionals evaluating Node.js application risks needing to understand language-specific vulnerabilities, and teams responsible for securing user data against increasingly sophisticated attacks. Those who focus on features without considering security implications will discover attacks targeting common coding patterns, learning to write defensive code anticipating malicious input rather than assuming good actors. The content particularly benefits developers of applications handling sensitive data like financial information, personal records, or authentication credentials where security breaches create legal liability and reputational damage. Anyone who has seen breach reports wondering how attackers exploited vulnerabilities will appreciate practical explanations showing vulnerable code patterns and secure alternatives enabling protection in own applications.

## Practical Applications

Readers will learn to prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries or ORMs escaping user input rather than string concatenation, mitigate XSS through output encoding rendering user content safely in HTML contexts, and validate input using libraries like joi or validator enforcing expected formats rejecting malicious payloads. The book demonstrates implementing authentication securely using bcrypt for password hashing with salt and iterations preventing rainbow table attacks, managing sessions through secure cookies with httpOnly and secure flags preventing JavaScript access and transmission over unencrypted connections, and implementing authorization checking user permissions at both API and data layers preventing privilege escalation. Practical examples cover protecting against CSRF using synchronizer tokens validating that requests originate from application pages, implementing rate limiting with express-rate-limit or Redis preventing brute force and denial of service attacks, and applying security headers like Content-Security-Policy restricting resource loading and X-Frame-Options preventing clickjacking. Advanced security patterns include implementing OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for secure delegated authentication, using JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication managing claims and expiration properly, and handling file uploads safely validating types and sizes preventing malicious file execution. The book provides dependency security practices using npm audit identifying vulnerable packages, keeping dependencies updated addressing disclosed vulnerabilities, and pinning versions preventing supply chain attacks from compromised updates. Monitoring and response strategies cover logging security events for audit trails and incident investigation, implementing intrusion detection monitoring for suspicious patterns, and establishing incident response procedures minimizing damage from successful attacks.
